    <h3> What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning? </h3>

    <p> When I initially started foundation I wasn't as aware of neuroplasticity and how amazing our brains truly are, so this 
        is probably the most interesting part of the core content. Also the fixed vs. growth mindset, definitely opened my eyes in relation 
        to which mindset I am in myself and how to maybe change that (or try to). <br>
        Generally a lot of the content I have touched base on in the past, but feel my knowledge in relation to Mindfullness has expanded.
        
    </p>


    <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>

    <p> I have always been quite self-aware, so a lot of the core content were only enforcing what I already knew. However, neuroplasticity 
        and trying to implement these techniques into my learning has broaden the way I learn and certainly taught me a lot. I have always 
        struggled with my self-conscious and are generally not very confident, which I definitely feel the core content has challenged. <br>
        I also feel that I have had to come to terms with my own stubborness when it comes to asking for help, and my communication skills can 
        and should improve - I feel I might have been stuck (and still am a bit) in a fixed mindset, rather than a growth mindset also.  
    </p>

    <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

    <p> I think if you're more self-aware of how you learn and honest in relation to how you work, it is also easier to improve. 
        This does not only refer to programming, but life as a whole. 
    </p>

    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

    <p>The neuroplasticity side of things when I was watching the YouTube videos, explaining how someone are able to increase their muscle
        mass by thought, or how just thinking about what you have been learning during that day can benefit you.
    </p>

    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

    <p> For me it was probably the looping and listening exercises. Being an introvert and very self-conscious it's extremely hard for me to think of what 
        I would like to say, but also the thought of maybe not understanding the other person (since english is my second language too!) 
    </p>

    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>

    <p> You are trying to make as valuable members of a team and not just knowledgable coders. Programming comes with experience, but the core
        skills can be what makes a difference during a job interview. 
    </p>

    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
        Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

    <p> I don't feel it is a waste of time, but I do feel something like the looping and listening skills are easier in the classroom 
        or pair programming (even though I haven't done this part just yet). Mindfullness and finding a balance has always been important to me, 
        especially since I have been through a lot of stress in my life and got a condition which easily puts me in flight-or-fight mode. <br>
        Learned quite a fair bit about growth vs. fixed mindset and how absolutely amazing our brains are if we take advantage of our 
        neuroplasticity. 
    </p>

    <h3>Expectations for Bootcamp...</h3>

    <p>Despite the last two sprint having been quite challenges (and as I am writing this I still got work to do!), I am really excited for bootcamp. <br>
        I have always wanted to do web development and programming, and have had hands on with some when I was younger and taken short courses. <br>
        A part of me would love to have my own web development business and be my own boss, being able to go wherever I like in the world 
        and spending more time with my family in Denmark and my puppy. <br><br>

        I have been struggling quite a fair bit with some of the JavaScript. I am the type of person who truly want to know how each little component 
        of my code works together, which might be a strength and downfall at the same time? I don't feel I necessarily get that from finding code online. 
        I am quite stubborn and do find it hard to ask for help, especially during foundation when I know our facilitors are busy. <br><br>

        Pair programming and looping exercises might be the areas I will struggle more with being an introvert as mentioned earlier, 
        and having a condition there often gives me "brain fog" I really need to be obs on making notes of our learning, so I can review again later. <br>
        This is actually also one of the reasons I like the idea of programming, since it's not the end of the world if I can't remember a particular function, 
        it's available online and other programmers got a lot of the same struggles (maybe to a less or more degree, we can't all be super(wo)man!) <br><br>

        I would love to gain more confidence when it comes to pair programming and grouping exercises - don't get me wrong, I am absolutely capable 
        of taking ownership and lead a group (I have done this many times in the past!), but if it's something I am unsure of - I very easily get lost in the group. <br>
        I am very self-conscious and the thought of doing e.g. pair programming is kinda scary and I feel like panicking (to be honest). <br><br>

        I think once I am at bootcamp and we have more day-to-day interaction with the teachers and getting to know everyone, it will also be a lot 
        easier for me to ask for help. While I do want to solve the problem myself, I am don't want to push it so far I am loosing out either. <br>
        Having to find that healthy middle ground is probably going to be the biggest challenge! I would say, I am lucky because I got someone 
        close to me who is a senior and worked in the field for quite some time. Having him next to me to fully explain the code and notch me in 
        the right direction has really been a saint!
