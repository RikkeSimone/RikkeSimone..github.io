        <h3>About me...</h3>


        <p> Hi everyone! My turn to tell a little about myself. As you probably already are aware of, my name is Rikke - culturally I am a Danish Viking! <br><br>
            When I was 19 - young, naive and a bit of an adventure seeker who definitely DIDN'T want to go straight to uni - my parents gave me the option of going to NZ and work as an Au Pair. 
            They definitely didn't want me backpacking in Asia which was my original plan. So, lo and behold, I ended up in this BEAUTIFUL country and now residing in Auckland. <br><br>

            My friends and family describes me as brave, persistent (a pain), honest, openminded, sensitive (sometimes TOO sensitive), but laid back and easygoing - I also got the memory equivalent to a strainer.
            I value family and self care is always a WIP. I am an introvert, but quickly ease up to new people once we get to know each other. 
            Spending time with my Border Collie Lily is everything - and I dream of having my own little petting zoo in the future! <br><br>
            
            I decided to join DEV Academy after going through a tough time emotionally at work (NZ Police Communicator) and needed to do some self reflection: WHEN am I in my happy place? What do I ACTUALLY enjoy to do?
            Then I realised I ALWAYS seems to go towards coding and Web Development. I used to run a blog when I was 18-19 touching base with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Php. The decision to stay in NZ ended up putting my study chances on hold. Two years ago I did a short course called Girl Code and really enjoyed that too. It's about time to do something I LOVE and build a career around that. Dev Academy seems to be the perfect place to start.
            I can't wait to get to know all of you and take this journey together over the next 15 weeks.
