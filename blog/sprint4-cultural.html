    <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>

    <p><b>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</b> <br>

        Neuroplasticity refers to our ability to learn and retain informationm, and how powerfull our thoughts alone can be. For an instance has there been carried out
        out research on people where one group learn the more traditional, practical way and the other group learn by simply thinking about the steps they are needed to take. <br>
        The resarch showed that our brain alone can help us become pretty amazing at whatever skill we are wanting to take up - this is better explained in the YouTube video provided. <br><br>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Ngs5_WXxfo" frameborder="0" 
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br><br>

        So, having an understanding of neuroplasticity can certainly benefit people on their learning journey. 
    </p>

    <p><b>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</b> <br>

      Personally I have been trying to use the power of thought and reflections to look back on what I have done throughout the day and following. Repitition of the material and 
      prectice, prectice, practice! On top of that, ensuring I get quality sleep and increase my own mindfulness to give my brain a chance to reset for more learning. 

    </p>

    <p><b>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</b> <br>

      I decided to investigate further what could increase my neuroplasticity as effectively as possible, which lead me to find Dr. Brady Salcido. According to him
      in order to help increase your neuroplasticity we need to consider the following areas: <br><br>

        Sleep! Enusre you get enough sleep to help your brain regenerate. Ensure you get your 7.5 hours of quality sleep each night.<br><br>

        Meditation & mindfulness, which we already have a lot of focus on within this course. Allowing yourself to take time out to meditate and treat yourself this way 
          will do wonders for your neuroplasticity. 
        <br><br>
        Exercise - especially aerobic exercises such as walking 3-4 times a week is very beneficial to our mood and regenrating our brain, so it is ready to learn and grow. <br>
        I found the following video which addresses exercise and how you can help increase your neuroplasticity with help of exercise by Dr. Wendy Suzuki: <br><br>

       <br><br>  
        Healthy diet - now, Dr. Brady Salcido believes in a ketogenic diet following the intermitting fasting principles. Due to my own health issues, I know personally 
          that keto and intermitting fasting helps me - but we are not all build the same way! You need to find the healthy diet there suits you and your schedule. <br>
          It is also mentioned that we need to ensure we get DHA (so omega-3) in our diet along with curcumins (or tumeric) which has shown to have very positive benefits for our brain.
      
       <br><br>

      For your reference, this is the full video made by Dr. Brady Salcido: <br><br>

    <h3>Having a Growth mindset</h3>

    <p><b>What does it mean to have a Growth mindset?</b> <br>

      If you have a growth mindset, you believe that it is possible to learn anything you set your mind on to! You understand that what you see, is not what you get 
      and there is potential for growth at any time you wish! If you feel you are bad at math? Someone with a fixed mindset would tell themselves "If I am not good at math now, 
      I will never be" - whereas someone with a growth mindset would rather have the tendency to say "I might not be good at math NOW, but I can be!" <br>
    </p>

    <p><b>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</b> <br>

      I did feel I have been aware of the growth mindset, but without really realising there was more to it than the very basic and being told "you can do anything you 
      set your mind to do". I am now more aware of the differences between having a fixed vs. growth mindset, which have enabled me to reflect more on "which mindset am I in?" 
            <br>
    </p>

    <p><b>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</b> <br>

      I feel I do need to remind myself sometimes, that even if I feel I really don't get something today - doesn't mean I won't get it tomorrow! Here I believe the use of 
      meditating and mindfulness will help me stay in a growth mindset and limit my time my fixed mindset.
