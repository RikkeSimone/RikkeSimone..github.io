        <h3>Identity, Values and Strenghts Exploration</h3>

        <q><i>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
            Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
            Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
            Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations. </i></q>


        <p> I moved to New Zealand in 2011 and ended up staying due to my ex partner. Unfortunately he was quite abusive, so our relationship ended just after I had got my residency. 
            This left me with the question, should I go back home to Denmark? Should I be with my family or should I stay in New Zealand for my own sake? 

            <br>

            This was a really difficult decision to make since I felt I was letting down my family and friends in Denmark, 
            while I didn't feel I was done with NZ or the friends I had gained here. Ultimately, I ended up making the selfish decision of staying. 
            I didn't feel I was done with NZ, and after spending time with someone who had robbed all individuality and decision making of me I wanted to be my own person.  

            <br>

            Danes are very family orientated, but at the same time also very patriotic. 
            For many it is almost seen as a betrayal if you settle in another country. Add to that the feeling of letting your family down or questioning if they will think any less of you for staying in another country. 
            I have always loved my family and I have never had anything fundamentally against living in Denmark, but I found a second home here in NZ. 
            It has meant I haven't seen family members for years now, I hear second hand information such as my mother being upset she might not be a part of choosing my wedding dress,
            and the fact that I am not a part of multiple babies life which has joined the family after I left Denmark. This has caused many tears on both parts and a lot of homesickness. 

            <br> 

            I decided to use the Meyer Briggs test to determine my personality and got the result of an INFJ. My core values are Empathy, Depth, Individuality and Compassion. <br>
            I am open to others point of view and like hearing and discussing different view points, but hate when people insist their view point is the only right way to do things.
            My biggest limitation is probably that I am an introvert and I can find it hard to express myself sometimes or getting to know new people. 
            This also means that the few people I got a strong bond to are very close friends. <br>
            Being Intuitive also means that I easily get bored from mundane tasks and prefer exploring and a more hands-on approach to my learning. This often limits my learning in some way, 
            and can force me to get stuck on simple tasks for longer. 
        </p>

        <q><i>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
            Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
            Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
            Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</i></q>

            <p> While still living in New Zealand, I do love my family and believe a close relationship to your family is paramount. Good food, good conversations and good experiences. 
                Above all, my culture is basically surrounded by the danish term "hygge" which you might or might not have heard of. It's me-time, family-time and social-times all in one.
                It's a nice evening in with candles, the fire going with a hot chocolate and a good book - treating yourself. <br>

                I am very open-minded and curious, which I believe you would need to be as a developer. You need to have the curiosity to research and the willingness to keep up with a very-fast growing industry. 
                New languages and new challenges will come your way every day. Where my limitations might be is being introverted. This is something I have worked on for quite some time, 
                and still continue to work on in our very extroverted world. It does mean however, that I have no issues working individually also and don't lean on someone else to get me going. <br>

                A previous work colleauge and myself did not have a very good working relationship and we were definitely not agreeing on how things should be done within the workplace. 
                As it is relayed in the meyer briggs test I did, if I am steamrolled by someone who insist there is only one way to do things and are close minded, I quickly shut off. 
                Generally my tactic ended up being to just focus on me and this particular colleague ended up continuing to work his own way. From a management perspective, we ended up not working on anything together,
                which meant I could focus on my work, but the tension never went away.
                I do believe that I now would change my strategy and try make the environment more workable between us, listen to what the other party got to say in depth - even if they are not willing to change their ways. 
                I would try to find a middle ground.
