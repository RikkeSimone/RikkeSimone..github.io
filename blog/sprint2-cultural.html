        <h3>Reflections</h3>

<ul>
    
    <li>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</li>
    <p>I would love to work in Web Development and potentially start up my own company offering assistance with web development and the like.</p><br>

    <li>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</li>
    <p>More confidence in myself and in the work I do. I was so nervous for sprint 1 that I had got a lot of it wrong, but I didn't! I am sitting with the same feelings this week. 
        Also, building a routine and continue to develop my problem solving skills throughout. 
    </p><br>

    <li>A description of your own strengths and limitations</li>
    <p>I am quite organised and truly enjoy the hands-on elements and challenges throughout the course! Where I am struggling a bit is sayign 'no' and getting away from the distractions at home.
        I also feel I need to sit down and really make a plan over what I am wanting to do that day! So far I have been really bad at doing this, especially when dealing with the more 'just sit and listen content'. 
    </p><br>

    <li>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</li>
<p> I will: get a more quiet spot at home, trying to get away from distractions. I also need to plan my days a lot better and outline what NEEDS to be done on the day. This week I ended up with a migraine and got qwuite set back, 
    because I wasn't focused the first couple of days of sprint 2. If I had it better planned, it would have given me more time to complete this sprint. 
</p><br>

<li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</li>
<p>I generally would prefer to find the answers myself, but realise that sometimes this is not going to be possible. 
    I will try limit struggling to maybe half an hour at a time before I seek assistance from the group and facilitators.</p>

    <li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
    <p>Having someone able to assist us when we need help, potentially in the foundation channel. I do think the facilitators have done a great job so far.
        Would also like clear quide in relation to what I did well and what I didn't do so well and what I might need to redo or research further.
    </p>

    <li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</li>
<p>No commitments at this stage where I would need to block off my time.</p>

</ul>
