    <h3> What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p> Emotional Intelligence covers a few areas, in particular our ability to recognise and understand our own emotions as well as others. It is our ability to motivate ourselves, and how we work with others. 

    </p>
   
    <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
    <p> IQ is used to measure your ability to learn and understand new situations, your reasoning skills and numerical ability. This is quite different to the EQ which focuses on our ability to empathise, 
      our intuition, resilience and our leadership skills. 
    </p>

    <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
    <p> Research has shown that our success in the work place depends 80% on our emotional intelligence vs. 20% of our intellect. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812021477" target="_blank">Source</a>. <br><br>

      This means that more and more work places are looking at a potential employees EQ rather than their IQ when they are hiring. Where the IQ can tell about your intellect, the EQ will tell them about
      how you work in a team, if you're able to empathise with others within the work place, if you're creative and proactive.
