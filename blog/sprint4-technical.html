    <h3> Solving a simple problem.... </h3>

    <p>  We all have challenges from time to time we need to solve one way or another. Sometimes it can even be a really simple problem, like, 
        at the start while setting up this blog I needed to link the CSS file, which carries all the styling of a homepage,
         to my blog pages. Since the CSS file is in a separate folder to the index (main page) file and the blog, I didn't realise it would cause the issues it did. <br> <br>

         See, when you are trying to link your styling page to the index file you need to put in a separate link (like the URL or address to a web page) telling the page where it can find the styling guideline for the page.
         Because the file is in a separate folder I need to put a ../ in front of the folder I can find the CSS file in, so I should have used the link/address: <br>
         "../styles/main.css" - but instead I had just used styles/main.css". "Styles" is the name of the folder the CSS file is in, "main" is the name of the file and .css is the file type. <br><br>

         It was something I should have picked up quickly and a very minor detail I didn't even think of while being so focused on getting my code right. In order to try and solve 
         this problem I ended up spending a lot of google searching and trying new things back and forth. In the end I asked my flatmate if he could see what was going wrong - 
         and surely enough, I just missed a couple of full stops! <br><br>

         Woops! But at least I have now learned to be careful and how to navigate properly between folders while writing code. 

    </p>

    <h3> Probem solving the elegant way... </h3>

    <p> At first I was thinking, is there an elegant way to solve a problem? Do I personally solve problems elegantly since I am clumsy and uncoordinated as heck? <br><br>

        During my first few weeks with Dev Academy I have definitely had my ups and downs so far, but my best "problem-solving" experience has probably been during Sprint 3, 
        when we were working on Applying classes - changing the color of a row of dots, as well as creating a little game. While I didn't know all the answers for sure, I felt confident
        enough to easily google search and even just giving it a try here and there in different ways to get the outcome I wanted. I felt really proud of myself for solving these
        two tasks as I did - and then all on my own! It definitely did teach me more about how great JavaScript and a brief insight into what JavaScript can be used for. 

    </p>

    <h3>All the different ways to problem solve...</h3>

    <p> There are many ways to problem solve. Some of the problem solving methods we use while coding are: <br><br>

        Pseudocode (simply put outlining what the code do/should be doing through out using comments //) <br>
        Trying something <br>
        Rubber ducky method (explaining the problem and solution to a rubber ducky, animal, toy, statue - anything other than human!) <br>
        Reading error messages<br>
        Console.logging<br>
        Googling<br>
        Asking your peers for help<br>
        Asking coaches for help<br>
        Improving your process with reflection<br><br>

        Personally I feel most confident so far googling, reading through the error messages, using console.logging, just keep trying a few different things or asking peers/coaches 
        for help if I get really frustrated! Even though I much prefer to solve the problem myself. <br>
        While I don't feel uneasy using reflection or pseudocode, I feel this just comes naturally while coding and after. <br>
        The only problem solving method I am a bit uneasy about and probably wouldn't be doing is the rubber ducky method, while I can understand how it might have benefitted some, 
        to me I feel a bit uncomfortable doing it in a home where it is not just myself :) instead I will explain to my flatmate to see if I truly understand the problem and solution instead.
